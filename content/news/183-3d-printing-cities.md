You're visiting Singapore in 2050.

Instead of seeing towering cranes dragging and dropping giant steel beams, you see a 3D printer towering over a high rise as it manufacturers layer by layer, floor by floor, with artificial intelligence "manning" the printer.

 

Is this even possible? It's definitely plausibly. We are already printing out habitats for ourselves as a species. Companies like Printhuest from Denmark are creating construction printers, like the [BOD2](https://3dprinthuset.dk/3d-construction-printer/).

Printing a high rise is just a seemingly more grandiose application, but one which we can expect to happen if technology keeps accelerating at an exponential pace.

 

What in the hell does this futuristic scene have to do with blockchain? The answer: a whole lot more than you'd think.

 

The value of LBRY lies in the fact that creators of digital content can sell their files directly to the users of those files without a third party. What's the application in this context?

 

Well, a building has many facets: its structure, its windows, its interior, its d√©cor, its lighting, its flooring, its walls, etc. You can make a long list of components; the point is that each of these components must be designed.

 

Designers can specialize in making various elements of the building. One designer specializes in uploading elegant stained glass creations, while another specializes in crafty lamp designs.

 

Together, these content creators of various building elements can enable architects to co-create buildings with the specialists, enabling intricacies previously unimaginable due to the extreme specialization at play.

 

Now this does beg the question: how do we know if the window specialist and the lighting specialist can design window and lamp implementations that successfully coexist in the same high rise? Why would we want a bunch of component specific architects in the first place? Couldn't one architect easily do a better job at making everything match?

 

These are rational concerns. Why would an architect need to purchase all the components of a building he's designing when he could just design each component to ensure aesthetic compatibility? The answer is that the architect can use the components designed by other creators for inspiration, and work with the component designers to make the components work for his specific creations.

 

Let's say it's 2050 and an architect is midway through his design of a 75 story skyscraper in Atlanta. He's now looking to add the lighting and windows, so he hops onto an architecture specific application of the LBRY protocol, RCHTCTR, to shop for some components. 

 

Playing around with the window designs, he's able to find the perfect match for the windows, so he pays the window designer .5 LBC ($100 at 2050 prices). He looks for a lamp designer but struggles to find one that fits in like the window does. However, he has found one design for a chandelier that is pretty close to what he needs, but the general shape of it is an equilateral triangle, not an isosceles triangle like he needs.

 

Well, what he can do is make a purchase-contingency, where he sends some LBC to the creator with a request to adapt the design to his building's aesthetic requirements. The architect can withdrawal his request at any time, and his reputation of withdrawals will appear on the blockchain so that he can't make an unlimited number of withdrawals. 

 

The lighting designer inspects the building file and gets a sense of the aesthetic before adapting his chandelier design to the aesthetic specificities of the building. Once the isoscelic file is approved by the architect, the designer gets paid (with no intermediaries involved).

 

Now the skyscraper has the ideal set of components, even though they weren't all originally one person's idea. The lead architect was able to concrete with other designers who sell 3D printable building files in order to construct a master file that the printer will read holistically, and print magnificently.
